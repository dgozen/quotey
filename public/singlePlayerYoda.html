				<li>Hello!</li>
				<li>Hmmhhmmm…</li>
				<li>Ready you are to begin?</li>
				<li>Jedi you wish to become?</li>
				<li>Annoying you are.</li>
				<li>Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.</li>
				<li>Do or do not. There is no try.</li>
				<li>That is why you fail.</li>
				<li>Yes!</li>
				<li>No!</li>
				<li>The greatest teacher, failure is</li>
				<li>Patience you must have my young Padawan.</li>
				<li>Powerful you have become, the dark side I sense in you.</li>
				<li>Control, control, you must learn control!</li>
				<li>Awkward moment this is.</li>
				<li>
					Secret, shall I tell you? Grand Master of Jedi Order am I. Won this
					job in a raffle I did, think you?
				</li>
				<li>
					How did you know, how did you know, Master Yoda?’ Master Yoda knows
					these things. His job it is.
